* George Carlin

Build Requirements
------------------

* ncurses headers and libs (package libncurses5-dev in debian, ncurses-devel in RH)
* glib-json (package libjson-glib-dev in debian, json-glib-devel in RH)
* expects 64 bit system

TODO
----

* BUG: handle window resizing
* BUG: segfaults on Fedora
* BUG: portability to 32 bit (reading v2 PSF font headers)
* check for json config in home directory, read it in
* write out default config on request
* error handling for unknown timezones
